        <p>
          Spotify has this annoying issue that doesn't allow you to share your "Liked Songs" list
        </p>
        <p>I made this tool to help you with that</p>
        <p>
          It'll create a new playlist on your account and will keep that playlist in sync with your
          Liked Songs list
        </p>
        <p>
          The list is updated regularly, but it's not instant, so you'll have to wait some time
          since you change your liked songs list. I'll try to keep that "regularly" as low as
          possible
        </p>
        <p>
          The tool will also add a snapshot of the liked songs list each day, for the last 5 days.
          I'll add a toggle for this in the future

          That's sad ðŸ˜¢. Just click here to
