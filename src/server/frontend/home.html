    <div id="explanation-wrapper">
      <p>Spotify has this annoying issue that doesn't allow you to share your "Liked Songs" list</p>
      <p>I made this tool to help you with that</p>
      <p>It'll create a new playlist on your account and will keep that playlist in sync with your Liked Songs list</p>
      <p>The list is updated regularly, but it's not instant, so you'll have to wait some time since you change your
        liked
        songs list. I'll try to keep that "regularly" as low as possible</p>
      <p>The tool will also add a snapshot of the liked songs list each day, for the last 5 days. I'll add a toggle for
        this
        in the future</p>
